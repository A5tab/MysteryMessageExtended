Hi ! 

Feeling excited to share my new Next.JS project.

and source code:

https://github.com/A5tab/MysteryMessageExtended

This project was created while learning Next.JS. Next.js is a powerful framework built on top of react providing more features like Server side rendering, SEO, file base routing make it easier to write your backend API and UI part in same framework. 

This project not only helps me learn the Next.js but also give me a chance to learn many other tools with it.



First let me introduce you to my project 'MysteryMessageExtended'. An anonymous feedback app where anyone could provide a link to accept feedback anonymously because i believe true feedback is given only when its anonymous. So anyone could get that link open it anywhere without any tension of any authentication, identity tracking could write anything while also getting feedback suggestions from AI I used Gemini API for this. Receiving user has its own dashboard securely accessed with next-auth authentication flow. User could also disable receiving feedback saving himself from receiving more messages.



Tools & Technologies Explored:

Gemini

NextAuth

Typescript

React-Hook-Form

ShadcnUI

TailwindCSS

Resend-Email for OTP codes

and obviously Next.js



Key-Features:

Debouncing Effect

OTP Code through email

Authentication

Suggestions from AI
